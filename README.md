## Random Trivia
### Etymology
https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=cartridge
The term 'cassette' stems from the old North French 'casse', meaning box, with the -ette indicating the dimunitive, or little, form.

The term 'cartridge' stems from the french term for a pistol or rifle charge wrapped in paper, which in turn comes from the Cartoushe of Egypt, which is a symbol wrapped in a scroll-like border.
