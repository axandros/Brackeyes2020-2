# Brackeyes2020-2
The Repo for the second 2020 Brackeyes game jam.
The theme is **Rewind**

## Design
Trading Sequence first person game in a time loop.
Find items in the world, give them to NPCs to get new items to finish a chain and complete the game.

## Trade Chain
Start in a garage, themed as a tape deck.  BLACK asks for the white tape, across the room. Giving him the WHITE Tape will open the door and start the 5 minute timer.
Each character is a color, and the RGB and CMY colors are the two chains.  So RED wants the RED TAPE and gives the GREEN TAPE.  The screen on each one will give you a number when they receive their colored Tape, and the last ones in each chain will give hints on how to get the BLACK Tape.
There's a locked building that needs a 6 digit key code to get into.  This code is generated at runtime and displayed on the screens of the bots you help.  A guide by the door gives you the color order.  A Machine in the building will accept the White tape and spit out the BLACK Tape.

## Resetting Early.
The WHITE Tape can be found next to BLACK at the start and giving it back to him will trigger the Rewind early.

## Random Trivia
### Etymology
https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=cartridge
The term 'cassette' stems from the old North French 'casse', meaning box, with the -ette indicating the dimunitive, or little, form.

The term 'cartridge' stems from the french term for a pistol or rifle charge wrapped in paper, which in turn comes from the Cartoushe of Egypt, which is a symbol wrapped in a scroll-like border.
