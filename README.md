# Brackeyes2020-2
The Repo for the second 2020 Brackeyes game jam.
The theme is **Rewind**

## Design
Trading Sequence first person game in a time loop.
Find items in the world, give them to NPCs to get new items to finish a chain and complete the game.

## Trade Chain
I want one part to be digging up a late item with a shovel found early on.  The knowledge is secret, but you can do it almost immediately.
